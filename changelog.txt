1.1.0 -- 2015-09-21

 + added several new visual customisation options
 
 * changed full-charge glow effect to apply on wings icon rather than entire button
 * (tech) added MovieClipHelper to help prevent symbolname+class collisions with other mods
  
  
1.0.0 -- 2015-09-20

 + icon is now colourised depending on which Ultimate Ability your character has received (gold / blue / purple)
 + glow effect now has a user configurable intensity level, and is optional
 + app is now fully integrated with the game's GUI Edit Mode
 + added hook for ElTorqiro_AegisHUD to know if default Animus charge bar is hidden
 
 * changed app icon to be simpler and less "scrappy" when in VTIO
 * updated config window to new style

 - removed ability to "disable" the hud with right-click on the app icon; unlike some other addons, it made no sense to be able to toggle this on/off
