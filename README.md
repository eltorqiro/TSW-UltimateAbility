ElTorqiro_UltimateAbility
=========================
An "Ultimate Ability" UI mod for the MMORPG "The Secret World"
   
   
What is this?
-------------
ElTorqiro_UltimateAbility is a customisable Ultimate Ability button.  Feature highlights:

* integrates an Animus charge meter into the button; the meter fills up as your Animus charges, and lights up when full
* option to hide the default Animus charge bar
* customisable colours and styles for the various button elements (looks nicer than the default button!)
* tints the button according to which Ultimate Ability your character has unlocked
* does not modify or override any game files

Donations
---------
I don't accept real-money donations for my mods.  If you would like to show your support, you can do so by sending in-game pax to my character Tufenuf.  I will use it to buy the in-game items I would otherwise have been able to grind out myself, if I weren't spending time writing mods.
  
  
Configuration
-------------
The mod includes an on-screen icon which can be clicked to bring up a comprehensive configuration panel.  If you have Viper's Topbar Information Overload (VTIO) installed, or an equivalent handler, the icon will be available in a VTIO slot.
   
Manipulating the button and the icon is done via TSW's Gui Edit Mode, which is toggled in the game by clicking the padlock symbol in the top right corner of the screen.  Left-button drags the button, and mouse wheel adjusts scale.  These instructions are repeated in the config window.
  
  
Installation
------------
The mod is released with CurseMod support, so you can use the Curse client to handle adding and removing it from the game.  Manual installation can also be done, as follows:
  
Manual Installation
Ensure the game is closed, then extract only the Flash folder from the zip file into TSW_GAME_FOLDER\Data\Gui\Customized
  
Manual Uninstallation
Ensure the game is closed, then delete the folder TSW_GAME_FOLDER\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\ElTorqiro_UltimateAbility
